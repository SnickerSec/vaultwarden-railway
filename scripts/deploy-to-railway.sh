Railway will automatically deploy your changes when you push to GitHub.

If your repository is connected to Railway, the deployment will start automatically.
If not, you can trigger a manual deployment from the Railway dashboard.

Monitoring Dashboard:
- Password: (the one you just set)
- Will be available at: https://your-service-name.up.railway.app

Services to configure in Railway Dashboard:
1. Main Vaultwarden service (existing)
2. PostgreSQL database (existing)
3. Monitoring dashboard (new - needs to be added)

Next Steps:
1. Go to Railway Dashboard: https://railway.app/project/$PROJECT_ID
2. Click "New" → "Empty Service"
3. Name it "monitor" or "vaultwarden-monitor"
4. Connect to this GitHub repository
5. Set root directory to "/monitor"
6. Railway will detect the Dockerfile and deploy automatically
7. Add a custom domain or use the Railway-provided URL

Environment variables are already set for the monitoring service.

Main service variables needed:
- DOMAIN (Vaultwarden URL)
- ADMIN_TOKEN (Vaultwarden admin token)
- SIGNUPS_ALLOWED
- DATABASE_URL (auto-injected by Railway)

Monitoring service variables (already set):
- MONITOR_PASSWORD_HASH ✓
- MONITOR_SECRET_KEY ✓
- MONITOR_PORT ✓
- DATABASE_URL (reference from PostgreSQL service)

To complete the deployment:

1. Add Monitoring Service in Railway Dashboard:
   - Go to your Railway project
   - Click "New" → "GitHub Repo" or "Empty Service"
   - If using GitHub: select this repository
   - If using Empty Service: will deploy from local
   - Set service name: "vaultwarden-monitor"
   - Set root directory: "/monitor"
   - Railway auto-detects Dockerfile

2. Configure Service Variables:
   - Most variables are already set via CLI
   - Add DATABASE_URL reference:
     DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}

3. Volume Mounts (if using shared storage):
   - Mount /backups to shared volume
   - Mount /scripts to shared volume
   - Mount /restore-logs to shared volume

4. Networking:
   - Expose port 5000 (auto-detected)
   - Add custom domain (optional)
   - Note the Railway-provided URL

5. Deploy:
   - Push to GitHub (if connected)
   - Or trigger manual deploy
   - Monitor deployment logs
   - Wait for health check to pass

6. Verify Deployment:
   - Access monitoring dashboard URL
   - Login with your admin password
   - Check system status
   - Create a test backup
   - Verify backup functionality

Troubleshooting:
- Check deployment logs in Railway
- Verify environment variables are set
- Ensure DATABASE_URL is accessible
- Check Railway CLI is installed in container
- Verify volume mounts if using shared storage
